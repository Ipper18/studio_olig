## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#673AB7), chosen for its balance of creativity and stability.
- Background color: Light purple (#F3E5F5), a very desaturated shade of the primary color, will serve as a gentle backdrop.
- Accent color: Blue-violet (#3F51B5), this neighboring color with different brightness and saturation will call attention to UI controls.
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern and readable interface. Good for both headings and body text.
- Tile-based layout for dashboard and folder navigation.
- Consistent and clear icons for file types (Excel, PDF, Images) and folder actions (create, open, etc.).
- Subtle animations for folder transitions and spreadsheet updates.
